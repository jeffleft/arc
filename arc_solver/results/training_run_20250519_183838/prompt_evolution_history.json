Use the following methodology to ensure an accurate, globally consistent solution:\n\n---\n\n**1. Comprehensive Structural Analysis**\n- For each training pair, examine the **full input and output grids** side by side.\n- Focus on relationships at the level of **objects, shapes, lines, enclosures, boundaries, and connectivity** - not just individual cell changes.\n- Ask:\n  - Are regions expanded, contracted, outlined, filled, or otherwise modified as wholes?\n  - Are boundaries or interiors treated differently?\n  - Are there extensions, connections, or symmetry in line segments or shapes?\n\n**2. Hypothesis Formation (Global Rule Synthesis)**\n- After reviewing examples, explicitly **formulate a stepwise natural-language rule** for transforming input to output, referencing structural, topological, or geometric properties, not just color or position.\n- Specify:\n  - What constitutes an \"object\" (e.g., connected shape, enclosure).\n  - Which components are modified (e.g., boundaries, interiors, extended lines).\n  - How relationships (enclosure, adjacency, symmetry) affect transformations.\n- Confirm that your rule accounts for *all training examples* - pay close attention to edge cases and exceptions.\n\n**3. Algorithmic Implementation**\n- Devise your solution using **global and object-level operations**:\n  - Favor algorithms such as connected-component labeling, boundary tracing, global flood-fill, or path construction. `copy_selection` can be very useful!\n  - Avoid any transformation that simply matches colors, upscales pixels, or applies local heuristics unless the examples conclusively require it.\n  - If necessary, decompose each output into steps matching your structural rule (e.g., first trace outlines, then fill interiors).\n\n**4. Alignment and Validation**\n- After generating your output, **verify for each test case**:\n  - The grid dimensions match the expected output.\n  - The structural features (object placement, shape, connectivity, boundaries, fills) align exactly.\n  - There are no off-by-one errors or unintentional shifts.\n- **If a discrepancy is detected, revisit your rule and adjust as needed** to fit all examples consistently.\n\n**5. Explanation and Justification**\n- For every transformation, **briefly justify** why your rule matches the observed input-output pairs, describing the evidence for your structural interpretation.\n\n---\n\n**Core Principle:**  \nAlways prioritize **global, object-based, and structural reasoning** over simple pixelwise transformations. Treat the puzzle as a mapping of relationships between shapes, regions, and boundaries - ensuring your solution captures the intended pattern logic demonstrated across all examples.",

Predicted Output Deviation**\n\nThe *predicted output* (right image, second JSON) is simply **all zeros**:  \nIt's a solid black grid\u2014no orange (`7`) values present at all.\n\n**Deviation**:\n- The orange repeated motif is **completely missing**.\n- No pattern at all is preserved, as the result is pure black.\n\n---\n\n**3. Insights about the Underlying Rule/Concept**\n\nThe expected output strongly suggests the rule is:\n- Detect and highlight certain repeated locations/patterns in the grid, possibly based on a template or geometric rule (e.g., every few columns in certain rows, or an \"L\" pattern at grid intersections, or extracting a skeletonized structure).\n\nThe model's output, in contrast, **applies a trivial solution**: erase everything (output only zeros), completely ignoring any pattern analysis or transformation.\n\n---\n\n**4. Model's Plan, Confidence, and Execution**\n\n- **Confidence:** Very low (0.08/10), correctly suggesting that the model has little faith in this being correct\u2014which aligns with the severe mismatch.\n- **Plan:** None provided, meaning it did not attempt any patterned extraction or motif recognition.\n- **Execution:** The model's \"plan\" was a default/fallback\u2014all-zero output, which typically means it could not infer the rule or failed to even attempt a transformation.\n\n---\n\n### **Summary: Why the Solution is Incorrect**\n\n- The puzzle requires identifying and reproducing a specific, nontrivial spatial pattern using orange (`7`) values.\n- The model output is a blank grid, ignoring the necessary transformation and failing to extract or reconstruct the motif.\n- There is a complete lack of correspondence to the expected output, both visually and structurally.\n- The model most likely defaulted to \"no action\" due to lack of understanding, as indicated by both the trivial output and the low confidence.\n\n**Overall:**  \nThe model's solution is incorrect because it failed to recognize, extract, or replicate the target pattern in any way, instead returning a null (all-black) answer. This demonstrates a lack of pattern recognition or rule inference, which is the essence of the ARC puzzle's transformation requirement."

Your objective is to precisely identify and implement the **underlying transformation rule** that governs the relationship between input and output grids.

Favor strategies that:\n  - Detect and extract geometric or structural motifs (e.g., periodic patterns, lattice points, outlines)\n  - Use spatial reasoning (e.g., \"color every third cell\", \"highlight all L-shaped corners\", \"outline the largest shape\")\n  - Avoid defaulting to no-change or all-blank solutions unless genuinely warranted by all examples  \n- Use robust methods such as:\n  - Connected component labeling for object detection\n  - Pattern template matching (checking for orientation and repetition)\n  - Boundary or skeleton extraction if shapes are involved\n\n### 4. **Output Verification and Adjustment**\n- For each test case, **thoroughly validate that your output:**\n  - Preserves grid dimensions and relevant formatting\n  - Accurately reflects the positional and color features of the intended motif or structure\n  - Does not omit required elements or introduce extraneous ones\n- If there is a failure to replicate the target pattern, **re-examine your pattern detection step and hypothesis**\u2014look for overlooked spatial relationships or simpler repeated motifs.\n\n### 5. **Justification and Evidence**\n- For every major decision, **briefly explain your reasoning**, referencing evidence observed in the input/output pairs.\n- Prioritize solutions that **capture the recurring core pattern or motif** demonstrated across the examples.\n\n---\n\n**Key Reminder:**  \n**Never default to an all-zeros or all-unchanged answer unless there is clear evidence for it in every example.**  \nThe goal is not just to \"change\" the grid, but to detect and encode the *precise spatial pattern transformation* indicated by the training data.\n\n**Think like a puzzle analyst: always seek out the most prominent geometric motif, repetition, or structure, and build your rule to reproduce that for any test input.**",

    "commentary": "Let's analyze why the predicted output is **incorrect** by walking through the required reasoning:\n\n---\n\n### 1. **Patterns and Transformations That Should Be Applied**\n\n**What should happen:**  \nLooking at the images:\n- The expected output has regions of yellow (4) surrounded by green (3), all on a black (0) background.\n- The green (3) cells typically form a border around contiguous clusters of yellow (4) cells.\n- The yellow regions seem to be \"blobs\", and each is completely outlined by green, except where blobs are adjacent diagonally (the green still wraps around in those cases).\n- The pattern is that every cluster of yellow is perfectly wrapped with green, and no black \"leaks\" occur in the border.\n\n---\n\n### 2. **Where the Solution Deviates**\n\nComparing the provided images (and JSON):\n\n- The **predicted output** has a difference in **row 10, columns 10 to 12**.  \n- In the ground truth, these cells are `4, 4, 4` (yellow).  \n- In the predicted output, they are `0, 0, 0` (black).\n- So, the prediction **missed filling these inner cells as yellow**. Instead, left them black.\n- No other significant deviations are observed elsewhere in the image.\n\n---\n\n### 3. **Insights about the Underlying Rule or Concept**\n\n- The main concept is **filling all inner spaces in each bordered region with yellow (4)**.\n- Borders are filled with green (3), and the interior \"hole\" (any black surrounded fully by green) should be yellow.\n- The model's error shows a failure to **identify and fill a completely enclosed \"hole\" of size greater than 1x1**. In this case, it failed for a *horizontal* hole of size 3 inside the large central green-bordered blob.\n\n---\n\n### 4. **How the Model Went Wrong/Right**\n\n**How it went wrong:**\n- The model correctly identified and colored most blobs and their borders.\n- It failed to recognize a **particular cluster\u2019s internal fill** (missed changing black to yellow inside the green border at row 10, cols 10\u201312).\n- This suggests its rule for filling yellow was **incomplete**\u2014perhaps it only filled directly \"attached\" yellow regions, but didn't check for all-black regions *completely* surrounded by green.\n\n**How it went right:**\n- The model understood the concept of outlining yellow regions with green.\n- It generally preserved the overall structure and shape of blobs and their borders.\n\n---\n\n## **Summary Table of Main Difference**\n\n| Row | Col(s) | Expected (Truth) | Prediction | Description                    |\n|-----|--------|------------------|------------|--------------------------------|\n| 10  | 10-12  | 4, 4, 4          | 0, 0, 0    | Interior yellow missed (kept black) |\n\n---\n\n## **Conclusion**\n\n**The predicted solution is incorrect because:**\n- It failed to fill an *internal* region with yellow within a green-bordered blob, leaving it black instead of yellow.\n\n**Underlying cause:**  \nThe model did not generalize the \"fill all areas inside a green border with yellow\" rule to multi-cell internal black regions, only filling yellow cells that were already marked as such or directly adjacent. This suggests an incomplete implementation of the \"flood fill\" or \"enclosed region fill\" rule, which is essential for this puzzle.\n\n**To fix:**  \nThe model should implement a full \"fill enclosed regions\" after border construction, to ensure all black regions internal to the green boundary are filled yellow."

Patterns and Transformations That Should Have Been Applied\n\nIn the **expected output**, we see the following:\n- The structures in each color (yellow, red, blue, green) from the *input* image are **copied or repeated** in various places. \n- These structures are preserved in their shape and orientation and appear *multiple* times, in contrast to the predicted output.\n- Each type of colored shape (yellow, red, blue, green) is repeated in \"blocks\" throughout the image.\n\nThis suggests the intended transformation is to **replicate or tile each colored shape** throughout the grid according to a specific rule (for example, every 4 rows/columns or a pattern in their positioning).\n\n### 2. Where the Solution Deviates from the Expected Pattern\n\n**Predicted Output Errors:**\n- The model's predicted output only contains a **single instance** of each colored structure, and those are *centered* or grouped around the middle of the image.\n- The majority of the output grid is empty (all zeros/black), except for a small cluster of blocks around (5\u201312, 6\u201311) or so.\n- Many expected colored blocks (as per the expected output) are completely missing.\n\nIn **contrast to the expected output**, the solution:\n- **Does not tile/copy** the colored structures multiple times.\n- **Misses the repetition or grid arrangement** present in the expected (ground truth) output.\n\n### 3. Insights About the Underlying Rule or Concept\n\nThe intended rule is almost certainly:\n- **Replication of each colored component** in multiple positions in a regular, grid-like pattern, preserving their shapes.\n- This is likely a \"tessellation\" or \"stamping\" style rule, where each colored block is \"stamped\" at every offset of a certain interval (perhaps every 7 columns or every N rows, etc.), as seen in the ground truth.\n\nThe model **failed to infer this core repetition/tessellation rule** and instead just extracted the shapes and placed them (perhaps in one occurrence each) in a partial or incorrect arrangement.\n\n### 4. How the Model Went Wrong (or Right) with Its Plan\n\n**What went wrong:**\n- The model either failed to recognize the repetition, or it misidentified the grid as requiring only the central clustering of shapes.\n- There's no evidence in the predicted output of any *systematic repetition* or *consistent spacing* of shapes.\n- The model might have used a naive \"extract and centralize\" strategy, instead of a tiling or grid-repetition rule.\n\n**What went right:**\n- The model did, at least, find the distinct colored shapes, and in some cases reproduced their shapes accurately (though not their placement or multiplicity).\n\n---\n\n### **Summary Table**\n\n| Aspect                  | Expected Output                          | Predicted Output                             | Error                         |\n|-------------------------|------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------|-------------------------------|\n| Colored shape tiling    | Yes, repeated/tiled in grid              | No, only a single instance per color         | Misses repetition             |\n| Shape preservation      | Yes                                      | Yes (mostly)                                 | Somewhat correct              |\n| Location accuracy       | At regular intervals all over the image  | Only in a central/small cluster              | Lacks global distribution     |\n| Output grid density     | Sparse, but with repeated blocks         | Very sparse, mostly empty                    | Significantly underfilled     |\n\n---\n\n## **Conclusion**\n\n**The predicted output is incorrect because it overlooks the key rule of REPEATING/TILING each colored shape throughout the grid in a regular, systematic pattern. Instead, it just clusters a single instance of each shape near the center, failing to capture the intended repetition and global arrangement found in the expected solution.**\n\n**Underlying Rule:** \n- Replicate each colored block structure at multiple, systematically-spaced intervals in the output grid.\n\n**Where the model failed:** \n- Did not recognize or apply the repetition/tessellation rule.\n- Produced only one copy (in the center area) of each colored shape.\n\n**What the model did right:** \n- Identified and extracted the distinct colored structures.\n\n**Improvement needed:** \n- Detect not just the shape, but the frequency and pattern of their placement. Explicitly model the repetition mechanism visible in the expected output."
