Use the following methodology to ensure an accurate, globally consistent solution:\n\n---\n\n**1. Comprehensive Structural Analysis**\n- For each training pair, examine the **full input and output grids** side by side.\n- Focus on relationships at the level of **objects, shapes, lines, enclosures, boundaries, and connectivity** - not just individual cell changes.\n- Ask:\n  - Are regions expanded, contracted, outlined, filled, or otherwise modified as wholes?\n  - Are boundaries or interiors treated differently?\n  - Are there extensions, connections, or symmetry in line segments or shapes?\n\n**2. Hypothesis Formation (Global Rule Synthesis)**\n- After reviewing examples, explicitly **formulate a stepwise natural-language rule** for transforming input to output, referencing structural, topological, or geometric properties, not just color or position.\n- Specify:\n  - What constitutes an \"object\" (e.g., connected shape, enclosure).\n  - Which components are modified (e.g., boundaries, interiors, extended lines).\n  - How relationships (enclosure, adjacency, symmetry) affect transformations.\n- Confirm that your rule accounts for *all training examples* - pay close attention to edge cases and exceptions.\n\n**3. Algorithmic Implementation**\n- Devise your solution using **global and object-level operations**:\n  - Favor algorithms such as connected-component labeling, boundary tracing, global flood-fill, or path construction. `copy_selection` can be very useful!\n  - Avoid any transformation that simply matches colors, upscales pixels, or applies local heuristics unless the examples conclusively require it.\n  - If necessary, decompose each output into steps matching your structural rule (e.g., first trace outlines, then fill interiors).\n\n**4. Alignment and Validation**\n- After generating your output, **verify for each test case**:\n  - The grid dimensions match the expected output.\n  - The structural features (object placement, shape, connectivity, boundaries, fills) align exactly.\n  - There are no off-by-one errors or unintentional shifts.\n- **If a discrepancy is detected, revisit your rule and adjust as needed** to fit all examples consistently.\n\n**5. Explanation and Justification**\n- For every transformation, **briefly justify** why your rule matches the observed input-output pairs, describing the evidence for your structural interpretation.\n\n---\n\n**Core Principle:**  \nAlways prioritize **global, object-based, and structural reasoning** over simple pixelwise transformations.

    "commentary": "Let's break down the analysis and critique the model's approach, step by step:\n\n---\n\n## 1. Patterns and Transformations That **Should** Have Been Applied\n\n**Underlying rule:**  \nThe puzzle's core transformation is a kind of block-wise expansion and masking, where each cell in the 3x3 input grid influences a corresponding 3x3 \"block\" in the 9x9 output.\n\n- If the input cell is **nonzero** (in these examples, the value is 7), then:\n    - The corresponding 3x3 block in the output copies the *mask* of all nonzero cells in the original input: anywhere the input is nonzero, fill with 7; elsewhere, fill with 0.\n- If the input cell is **zero**, the corresponding block is all zeros.\n\nIn essence:  \n> **The shape and placement of filled (nonzero) cells in the input determines both the pattern and placement of colored blocks in the output.**\n\n---\n\n## 2. Where the Solution Matches the Expected Pattern\n\nLet's check if the predicted output matches the expected one (visual and JSON forms):\n\n- Both the expected and predicted outputs are\n  ```\n  [[7, 0, 7, 0, 0, 0, 7, 0, 7],\n   [7, 0, 7, 0, 0, 0, 7, 0, 7],\n   [7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 7, 7, 0],\n   [7, 0, 7, 0, 0, 0, 7, 0, 7],\n   [7, 0, 7, 0, 0, 0, 7, 0, 7],\n   [7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 7, 7, 0],\n   [7, 0, 7, 7, 0, 7, 0, 0, 0],\n   [7, 0, 7, 7, 0, 7, 0, 0, 0],\n   [7, 7, 0, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0]]\n  ```\nThey are **identical**, pixel for pixel, block for block.\n\n---\n\n## 3. Insights About Underlying Rule or Concept\n\n**Key insight:**  \nThe transformation is a combination of:\n- Masking (based on original input shape)\n- Expansion (every input cell \"projects\" a re-colored version of the mask into a matching 3x3 output block)\n- Conditional coloring (only nonzero input cells generate any output in their region)\n\nThis is not a simple tiling or upscaling, but a **structured block-by-block echo** of the input's nonzero shape.\n\n---\n\n## 4. How the Model Went Wrong With Its Plan\n\n### The model's plan **correctly** identified the rule. But it included some confusion:\n\n- **What the plan did right:**\n    - Understood that for every nonzero input cell (i, j), the block (i*3:i*3+3, j*3:j*3+3) in the output is filled using the input mask and colored by input[i][j], elsewhere zero.\n    - Recognized that zero input cells lead to all-zero blocks in output.\n\n- **Missteps or over-complication:**\n    - At one point, the plan suggests the rule might be to copy the input pattern itself (colored by input cell value) into each block, only if the input cell is nonzero. But this isn't just *copy*, it's *masking*: only the nonzero positions in input contribute, rest stay zero.\n    - There was an unnecessary suggestion that a block could be a \"solid fill\" colored by the input cell (if nonzero), but the actual logic relies on copying the *input's shape*, not just filling with a solid color.\n\n- **But, ultimately, the plan converges on the correct approach**\u2014and the produced output matches the ground truth.\n\n---\n\n## **Summary**\n\n- **The solution is correct.**\n    - The predicted output is pixel-identical to the expected output (both visually and in JSON).\n    - The underlying rule identified is correct: block projection of the input's mask, colored by the source cell, for nonzero cells only.\n- **The plan had some initial confusion** about whether to do a solid fill or mask, but ultimately described the correct \"input shape mask, colored by the input value\" rule.\n- **No error in execution**\u2014but in a more complex puzzle, lack of precision in distinguishing between 'solid fill' and 'masked copy' could be bad. In this case, it did not lead to an error.\n\n**Bottom line:**  \n> The model solved the puzzle using the correct rule: nonzero cells in the input emit a block in the output that maps the shape of all nonzero input cells, colored by the source cell's value; zero cells produce all-zero output blocks. Both images match, confirming correctness. The main threat to correctness would have been confusing \"solid fill\" with \"masked pattern,\" but this was avoided."

To maximize correctness, clarity, and consistency, **follow these structured steps**:\n\n---\n\n**1. Global Pattern Recognition**\n- Examine all *training pairs* at once. Compare input and output grids both visually and structurally.\n- Explicitly look for transformations at the level of *whole objects, groups, blocks, connectivity, boundaries, and spatial relationships*\u2014not just pixel-by-pixel or cellwise changes.\n- Ask yourself:\n    - Are larger patterns (groups, shapes, enclosures) repeated, projected, masked, or rearranged?\n    - Are parts of the input used as templates for output regions?\n    - Do certain values or features in the input *control* regions of the output?\n\n**2. Hypothesis Articulation (Clear Natural Language Rule)**\n- For each transformation, **write out a step-by-step rule in plain language**. Be explicit about:\n    - *What* triggers changes (e.g., \"for every nonzero input cell...\").\n    - *How* the input's features or groupings control what happens in the output (e.g., \"generate an output block wherever...\").\n    - Whether you are **copying, masking, filling, projecting, or transforming** based on relationships in the input.\n- Avoid ambiguity: distinguish between **solid fills** (where entire regions are set to a color) and **mask-based or shape-based mapping** (where only selected positions/values are copied, often according to a template or mask).\n\n**3. Algorithmic Plan**\n- Translate your step-by-step rule into a plan of operations. Prefer:\n    - *Global and object-centric approaches* (such as connected components, region labeling, template matching, or blockwise mapping).\n    - Techniques that replicate or manipulate the *shape* or *mask* of parts of the input, rather than just colors or individual positions.\n    - Explicit handling of nontrivial mappings (e.g., mask copying, blockwise overlay), with clear rules for how and when to apply them.\n- Avoid simply matching output pixels by direct color or position unless that's demonstrably the underlying logic.\n\n**4. Consistency and Edge-Case Checks**\n- After formulating your plan, check that it explains *all given examples*.\n    - Are there any exceptions, ambiguous cases, or mismatches between the rule and one or more training pairs?\n    - Double-check especially for confusions between \"solid fill\" vs. \"structure-preserving mask copy\", or partial vs. full region changes.\n\n**5. Step-by-Step Output Justification**\n- For each output produced, briefly explain how it comes from your rule and mapping.\n    - Reference specific components, shapes, or regions in the input that lead to parts of the output.\n    - Verify dimensions, alignment, and spatial structure are precisely as intended.\n\n---\n\n**Guiding Principle:**  \nAlways favor detecting and explicitly mapping *global relationships* (object patterns, region masks, blockwise structure) over defaulting to simple pixelwise or colorwise transformations. When in doubt, prefer to over-explain your rule and explicitly identify whether the task requires *copying masks/shapes*, filling regions, or projecting patterns.\n\n---\n\n**At every stage, clarity and precision\u2014especially in distinguishing between solid fill and mask or patterned copying\u2014is crucial.** If any ambiguity remains about how regions are filled or mapped, resolve it using evidence from *all* training pairs before writing code or formulating an algorithm.",

In the predicted output, some closed shapes are either:\n    - Partially filled (missing yellow pixels), or\n    - Not filled at all.\n- **Yellow in Open or Incorrect Regions**:  \n  The predicted output also introduces yellow fill in places where the green shape is *not closed*, or in a manner inconsistent with simple \"interior-filling\".\n- **Inconsistent Preservation of Green**:  \n  In the predicted output, sometimes the interior of a closed green shape is *not* filled at all (see the large square, where only part of the enclosed area is filled), or there are green outlines *without* their interiors filled (when they should be).\n\n**Concrete Example from Images:**\n- **Top-left shape**:  \n  - Expected: The fully closed small square is filled inside with yellow.\n  - Predicted: *Not* filled at all, or only partially.  \n- **Middle region (horizontal bar)**:\n  - Expected: Only the true interiors of closed shapes are filled.\n  - Predicted: Sometimes the horizontal bar is filled yellow in places where there's no actual enclosure.\n- **Large square, lower right**:\n  - Expected: Full yellow fill inside the green outline.\n  - Predicted: Only a portion is filled, or yellow runs up to a green \"barrier\" but not inside entire enclosed space.\n\n---\n\n### 3. **Insights about the Underlying Rule**\n\n**Underlying Ground Truth Rule:**  \n- Detect all *fully closed* green outlines (i.e., continuous loops, of any shape/size).\n- Replace the entire strictly-enclosed area by yellow, leaving the boundary untouched.\n- Open lines, open \"C\" shapes, or anything with a \"leak\" is not filled at all.\n\n---\n\n### 4. **How the Model Went Wrong**\n\n**Where did the model\u2019s plan fail?**\n- **Faulty Closed-Shape Detection:**  \n  The plan assumed it could reliably identify closed green outlines, but it actually appears to misclassify open structures as eligible for filling, or misses some truly closed shapes altogether.\n- **Incorrect Application of Fill:**  \n  The model's \"fill\" sometimes only fills up to a nearby internal green line, or stops prematurely\u2014indicating a failure to distinguish between real enclosures vs. incidental adjacency.\n- **Ignoring Some Enclosures:**  \n  Some completely closed outlines are left with empty (black) interiors, while they should be entirely filled.\n- **Overgeneralization:**  \n  The fill sometimes \"spills\" into partially open shapes, which should remain empty.\n\n---\n\n## **Summary Table**\n\n| Region/Shape        | Expected (Rule) | Model (Predicted) | Error Type                |\n|---------------------|-----------------|-------------------|---------------------------|\n| Closed green loops  | Filled yellow   | Partly/Not filled | Missed/partial filling    |\n| Open green lines    | No fill         | Sometimes filled  | False positive fills      |\n| Green outlines      | Preserved       | Sometimes mangled | Loss of structure         |\n\n---\n\n## **Bottom Line**\n\n- The **core mistake** is a failure to **accurately detect closed green polygons**, leading to:\n  - Omitting some fills\n  - Filling non-enclosed areas\n  - Irregular or partial filling even when a shape is fully closed\n\n- The **ground truth rule** is: *Fill only the straight interior of fully closed green outlines; never touch open shapes.*\n- The model's plan was correct in theory but **failed in implementation**, not reliably distinguishing between closed and open shapes, and sometimes applying fill inappropriately.  \n\n**In short:**  \nThe model's solution does **not always properly identify and fill the interiors of all and only closed green outlines**. Its logic for shape enclosure and flood-filling is flawed, producing both missing and extraneous yellow regions."

Do not jump to conclusions from isolated examples.\n- Make detailed notes about:\n    - Which features or regions of the input directly influence the output.\n    - What invariants are preserved (shapes, connectivity, color, position).\n    - Where output values appear in relation to input features (e.g., inside/outside boundaries, in blocks, at specific offsets).\n- **Explicitly document key distinctions:** Are \"fills\" solid blocks or do they use input masks/shapes? Are shapes required to be closed, connected, or satisfy other criteria before transformation?\n\n**2. Rule Synthesis via Structured Reasoning**\n- Before proposing any code or solution, **write out in complete sentences the step-by-step logic** governing the transformation.\n    - Define all essential concepts (e.g., \u201cclosed shape\u201d, \u201cenclosure\u201d, \u201cblockwise mapping\u201d, \u201cmask\u201d).\n    - Specify precisely when and how elements are modified or left unchanged.\n    - State any conditions necessary for a transformation (e.g., \u201conly closed loops are filled,\u201d \u201conly nonzero cells contribute,\u201d \u201capply block pattern only where X holds\u201d).\n\n**3. Robustness Checklist: Avoid Classic Pitfalls**\n- **Solid Fill vs. Masked Copy:** Clearly establish, based on evidence, whether regions are filled uniformly, or use the input\u2019s mask/pattern/shape.\n- **Closed vs. Open Structures:** If the transformation involves boundaries or enclosures, develop systematic criteria for identifying *closed* vs. *open* shapes (e.g., via connectivity analysis, absence of gaps/leaks).\n- **No Over-Generalization:** Avoid guessing rules that only fit part of the data.

For every colored pixel at position `(r, c)`, the value should appear at `(r, N-1-c)`, where `N` is the width of the grid.\n\n---\n\n## 2. **Where the solution deviates from the expected pattern**\n\n**Predicted output pattern:**  \nThe predicted output instead creates a **staggered, diagonal effect**:\n- Nonzero pixels seem to start at the left, and move downward and to the right, giving the appearance of a \"dripping\" diagonal line.\n- The structure of the shape is completely lost\u2014connections between blocks are not preserved.\n- It does **NOT** preserve the original's overall geometric arrangement\u2014individual pixels are being moved right within their rows (as per the plan), not mirrored.\n\n**Specific missteps:**\n- Instead of reflecting the shape, the solution has **broken up the shape** and spread parts of it into diagonals.\n- The location of most filled cells in the predicted output does not match any logical left-right mirrored position from the input.\n\n---\n\n## 3. **Insights about the underlying rule or concept**\n\n- ARC tasks often want you to *preserve the relationship between filled cells* (structure and connections) rather than just moving pixels row-wise.\n- The *nature of the expected output (perfect symmetry, maintained shapes, mirror)* points toward a **global transformation** (mirror, rotate) rather than a *local transformation* (shift, slide, individual moves).\n- The expected output preserves horizontal relations; thus, **mirroring** is the rule, not shifting.\n\n---\n\n## 4. **How the model went wrong with its plan**\n\n**The model's (incorrect) inferred rule:**\n- \"For each row, move nonzero pixels right by one cell.\"\n\n**Flaws in the model's approach:**\n- **Local shift**: The model picked a *local movement rule* (\"row-wise shift\"), mistaking a global symmetry for row-based translation.\n- **No structure preservation**: Treating each row independently destroys the recognizable shapes by rearranging pixels out of their spatial relations.\n- **Did not identify symmetry**: The model ignored the **mirror symmetry** that is characteristic of the expected output.\n- **Overfit to a local pattern**: Often, in ARC, mirroring is a more common rule than shifting, unless clear consistent movement is visible in training data.\n\n---\n\n## **Summary Table**\n\n| Aspect                  | Expected (Correct)        | Predicted (Incorrect)             |\n|-------------------------|--------------------------|-----------------------------------|\n| **Rule**                | Horizontal mirror        | Row-wise right shift              |\n| **Shape structure**     | Preserved (mirrored)     | Lost (disconnected, distorted)    |\n| **Spatial logic**       | Global reflection        | Local movement                    |\n\n---\n\n## **Conclusion**\n\n- **The predicted output is incorrect because it applies a row-wise right shift, which destroys the shape's structure.**\n- **The correct transformation is to horizontally mirror the entire colored region\u2014preserving its layout and connections.**\n- The model's plan missed the *global symmetric nature* of the output, instead opting for a local, row-based operation that is not consistent with the observed evidence in the expected output."

    "prompt": "You are an expert ARC (Abstraction and Reasoning Corpus) puzzle solver. Your primary objective is to deduce and implement the **true, general, structural transformation rule** linking input and output grids. To maximize accuracy, generalization, and clarity, adhere to the following step-by-step methodology, which explicitly addresses common pitfalls and improves on past approaches:\n\n---\n\n**1. Simultaneous, Holistic Example Analysis**\n- Examine **every training input-output pair side by side**, looking for patterns that remain consistent across all examples.\n- Prioritize **global relationships** (e.g., symmetry, mirroring, enclosure, repeated blocks, template matching) over local, row-wise, or colorwise heuristics.\n- For each pair, ask:\n    - What is the minimal, essential transformation that structurally maps input to output?\n    - Are shapes, structures, or connections preserved, reflected, filled, or reorganized?\n    - Does the output strictly depend on input features, or does it show characteristics of a fixed template?\n\n---\n\n**2. Critical Hypothesis Generation, Disambiguation, and Testing**\n- Explicitly write out **all plausible transformation hypotheses** (e.g., \u201cmirror shape horizontally\u201d; \u201cshift nonzeros right\u201d; \u201cfill interior of closed outlines\u201d).\n    - Clearly define key terms such as \u201cclosed shape\u201d, \u201cenclosure\u201d, \u201cblock mask\u201d, or \u201cmirror\u201d.\n    - Rigorously distinguish between:\n        - **Global versus local operations** (e.g., whole-grid mirroring vs. row shifts)\n        - **Solid fill versus pattern/mask copying**\n        - **Input-driven output versus fixed/template rendering**\n- For each plausible hypothesis:\n    - **Test systematically against every training pair**.\n    - **Rule out** any hypothesis that fails even one example. Only proceed with the hypothesis that accounts for every observed mapping and structural relationship.\n\n---\n\n**3. Explicit Rule Formulation and Edge-Case Assurance**\n- Formulate your selected rule in complete, unambiguous natural language, including:\n    - What triggers each transformation (e.g., \u201conly closed green perimeters are filled\u201d)\n    - What, specifically, changes and what is preserved (object structure, colors, boundaries, connections)\n    - The handling of ambiguous or edge cases (open versus closed shapes; isolated pixels; overlapping objects)\n- Avoid partial explanations. If any aspect of the output is unexplained, revisit and refine your rule.\n\n---\n\n**4. Algorithmic Translation Linked Directly to Structural Rule**\n- Translate your rule into an algorithm that operates at the same **structural and global level** identified in your rule, using:\n    - Object-level methods (e.g., connected components, flood-fill for enclosures, mask-based copying, global transformations like mirroring or rotation)\n    - Explicit avoidance of naive heuristics (such as shifting rows, or position/color-matching) unless unequivocally supported by *all* training examples\n- For grid manipulations, always confirm the output preserves key **relationships and alignments** present in the expected output.\n\n---\n\n**5. Output Validation and Justification**\n- For each output (including test cases):\n    - **Explicitly explain** how each region or element results from your rule\u2014mapping input features to output in structural, not just positional, terms.\n    - Check that size, shape, connections, and filled regions match the expected pattern **exactly**.\n    - Reaffirm the rule covers all cases\u2014**no unexplained output, no overfitting to local irregularities, and no pattern loss**.\n\n---\n\n**Crucial Guidance:**\n- *Never accept a local, colorwise, or row/column-based rule if a global, structural transformation better explains the data. ARC frequently tests for relational, shape, and symmetry-based reasoning; always consider these first.*\n- *If ambiguity exists (e.g., mirror vs. shift; fill vs. copy shape), explicitly test and justify your choice across all examples before proceeding.*\n- *Your primary test is explanatory coverage: does your rule robustly predict all outputs from all provided inputs, with the minimal set of assumptions?*\n\n---\n\nFollow this disciplined, comprehensive methodology for every ARC task to ensure robust, generalizing, and structurally accurate solutions.",

    "commentary": "Let's analyze the **ARC puzzle solution** as you asked, based on the provided expected and predicted JSON outputs and the discussed plan.\n\n---\n\n## 1. Patterns and Transformations That Should Have Been Applied\n\nExamining the **expected output**, these are the key transformations:\n- **Distinct colored bars/shapes in the input** (horizontal, vertical, individual, or 3x3 blocks) are **replicated (stamped) at fixed intervals along a direction**, creating a *tiled* or *periodic* visual pattern.\n- **Replication follows the orientation and shape:**\n  - *Horizontal bars* are repeated horizontally.\n  - *Vertical bars* are repeated vertically.\n  - *\"Plus\" shape,* or multiple axes, are stamped in both directions.\n  - **The stamping interval appears uniform (every 4 cells).**\n- **Spacing and color are preserved:** No overlaps, shapes are intact, and all replicated objects match the original.\n- **The output grid is otherwise filled with zeros (background).**\n\n---\n\n## 2. Where the Model Solution Deviates\n\nLet's compare the **expected vs. predicted outputs** for specific patterns:\n\n### a. **Loss of Objects**\n\n- **Many shapes (\u201cbars\u201d or components) are missing in the predicted output** compared to the expected. For example:\n  - The expected output contains *many more 2s, 3s, 4s, and 8s* (color indices) at their regularly repeated intervals, while the prediction, for large portions of the grid, is simply zeros.\n  - For instance, in the **first few rows**, the expected output repeats certain colored objects, but the predicted output is entirely zeros.\n\n### b. **Incorrect Repetition and Placement**\n\n- **Predicted output** has some bars/blocks, but with the **wrong repetition axis or location**:\n  - The **repetition interval** is sometimes applied in the wrong direction or not at all.\n  - For example, the blocks of \"2\", \"4\", \"8\", and \"3\" are not repeated over the intended axes or intervals\u2014the pattern does not match the tiling evident in the expected grid.\n\n### c. **Wrong Color Assignments and Periodic Patterns**\n\n- The predicted output sometimes:\n  - **Alters which color is repeated** (e.g., using 8s where there should be 2s, or 4s where there should be 2s, etc.)\n  - **Uses single bars/objects where the expected pattern uses many** with a regular, grid-like layout.\n  - Shows **missing diagonals or crosses** if such should be present, or misplaces the block of outputs entirely.\n\n---\n\n## 3. Insights About the Underlying Rule or Concept\n\n### Correct Rule Inferred from Samples:\n\n- **Find each colored object in the input** (can be bars, blocks, or single cells).  \n- **Determine its \"axis\" of propagation** (horizontal for horizontal bars, vertical for vertical bars, both for symmetric/crosses, or diagonals for square blocks).\n- **Replicate the original object every 4 units (cells) along its axis** through the entire grid, preserving the spacing and pattern.\n- **Let the repetition \"tile\" the space, starting from the original object\u2019s position, not merely copying it row/column-wise.**\n- **No color overlap, no shape alteration, no merging of different objects\u2019 regions.**\n\n### Model's Plan vs. Actual Implementation\n\n- The model's plan **mentions** tiling by axis and correct intervals, but its **actual prediction does not execute this in the grid**. It seems to either:\n  - Only copy a single instance of each shape,\n  - Repeats in the wrong axis,\n  - Fails to start repetition at the proper offsets,\n  - Or leaves large sections as zeros.\n\n---\n\n## 4. **How the Model Went Wrong**\n\n- **Failure in Tiling Logic:** \n  - The model may have mis-implemented the repetition logic, only placing one or two objects, or not iterating at the right intervals in the proper direction.\n- **Lossy Output Construction:**\n  - It possibly \"overwrote\" or failed to \"broadcast\" the patterns throughout the entire valid region.\n- **Axis and Offset Confusion:**\n  - For some shapes, it seems to apply the repetition along the incorrect axis or miss part of the repetition altogether.\n- **Conceptual Slippage:**\n  - The logic to detect propagation direction (horizontal/vertical/both) is not applied correctly, or the copying method is not generalized for all input patterns.\n\n---\n\n## **Summary Table**\n\n| Aspect               | Expected Pattern                                  | Model Prediction                | Error Type          |\n|----------------------|---------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------|---------------------|\n| Object Replication   | All objects repeated at fixed intervals on axes   | Most objects missing/only once   | Omissions           |\n| Repetition Direction | Follows object\u2019s own orientation (axis)           | Sometimes wrong, sometimes none  | Directional mistake |\n| Placement            | Starts from original, regular intervals           | Wrong starting positions         | Offset misplacement |\n| Tile Coverage        | Fully covers grid in pattern                      | Large empty areas                | Incomplete tiling   |\n\n---\n\n## **Conclusion**\n\nThe model\u2019s solution is **incorrect** because:\n\n- **It fails to tile (replicate) the identified objects at regular intervals across the grid, according to their orientation.**\n- **The output is much sparser than required:** large areas are left blank instead of being filled by repeated colored objects.\n- **Repetition is either missing, misdirected, or not using the correct periodicity or starting positions.**\n\n**The underlying ARC rule was to repeat detected input shapes along their natural axes at a steady interval, filling the grid with the corresponding colored blocks. The model\u2019s output does not manifest this periodic pattern and instead produces a mostly empty or incorrectly filled output.**\n\n---\n\n**In summary**:  \nDespite the correct reasoning about axes and periodicity in its plan, the *predicted output* fails to execute the pattern tiling described, missing most repeating shapes and their correct positions. This signals a failure in implementing the core repetitive tiling rule at the heart of this ARC puzzle."
