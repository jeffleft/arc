Use the following methodology to ensure an accurate, globally consistent solution:\n\n---\n\n**1. Comprehensive Structural Analysis**\n- For each training pair, examine the **full input and output grids** side by side.\n- Focus on relationships at the level of **objects, shapes, lines, enclosures, boundaries, and connectivity** - not just individual cell changes.\n- Ask:\n  - Are regions expanded, contracted, outlined, filled, or otherwise modified as wholes?\n  - Are boundaries or interiors treated differently?\n  - Are there extensions, connections, or symmetry in line segments or shapes?\n\n**2. Hypothesis Formation (Global Rule Synthesis)**\n- After reviewing examples, explicitly **formulate a stepwise natural-language rule** for transforming input to output, referencing structural, topological, or geometric properties, not just color or position.\n- Specify:\n  - What constitutes an \"object\" (e.g., connected shape, enclosure).\n  - Which components are modified (e.g., boundaries, interiors, extended lines).\n  - How relationships (enclosure, adjacency, symmetry) affect transformations.\n- Confirm that your rule accounts for *all training examples* - pay close attention to edge cases and exceptions.\n\n**3. Algorithmic Implementation**\n- Devise your solution using **global and object-level operations**:\n  - Favor algorithms such as connected-component labeling, boundary tracing, global flood-fill, or path construction. `copy_selection` can be very useful!\n  - Avoid any transformation that simply matches colors, upscales pixels, or applies local heuristics unless the examples conclusively require it.\n  - If necessary, decompose each output into steps matching your structural rule (e.g., first trace outlines, then fill interiors).\n\n**4. Alignment and Validation**\n- After generating your output, **verify for each test case**:\n  - The grid dimensions match the expected output.\n  - The structural features (object placement, shape, connectivity, boundaries, fills) align exactly.\n  - There are no off-by-one errors or unintentional shifts.\n- **If a discrepancy is detected, revisit your rule and adjust as needed** to fit all examples consistently.\n\n**5. Explanation and Justification**\n- For every transformation, **briefly justify** why your rule matches the observed input-output pairs, describing the evidence for your structural interpretation.\n\n---\n\n**Core Principle:**  \nAlways prioritize **global, object-based, and structural reasoning** over simple pixelwise transformations. Treat the puzzle as a mapping of relationships between shapes, regions, and boundaries - ensuring your solution captures the intended pattern logic demonstrated across all examples.",

The predicted output, however, uses the same motif as above: large solid blocks without the inner details.\n\n---\n\n### 3. **Any insights about the underlying rule or concept**\n\n#### **True underlying rule:**\n- The output structure is **not block-wise replacement**.\n- The arrangement is based on repeating certain rows and columns with specific \u201chollow\u201d or \u201ccore\u201d patterns, with 7's outlining certain positions and 0's inserted inside \u2014 it suggests a more global, positional transformation.\n- There is *not* a straightforward mapping from each cell of the input to a masked 3\u00d73 tile in the output.\n- In **expected output**, sections are shifted and patterned in a much more nuanced way.\n\n#### **The predicted pattern:**\n- The prediction simply repeats a fixed 3\u00d73 mask, based on color.\n- It erases the middle rows entirely, indicating a misunderstanding about the global structure.\n\n---\n\n### 4. **How the model went wrong with its plan**\n\n- **Fundamental error:**  \n  The model **assumed** the output was composed of 3x3 blocks, each generated by masking the input with a simple rule, and **tiled** in a grid. In truth, the output's pattern is not block-tiling but rather a coordinated arrangement of 7\u2019s and 0\u2019s along rows and columns.\n\n- **Incorrect masking:**  \n  The plan used the rule: *\u201cfor each input cell, if nonzero, fill the corresponding block by replacing all nonzero values with the cell\u2019s color and zeros with zero.\u201d*  \n  This produces uniform, blocky patterns and sets whole regions of the output to zero (especially for central blocks or zeros in the input) \u2014 **which does not match the output's more intricate, connected pattern**.\n\n- **Misses global structure:**  \n  The model\u2019s plan completely ignores the **row-column relationships and placements** required to create the unexpected \u201cL\u201d or hollow patterns. Instead, it applies an overly local, repetitive transformation.\n\n---\n\n## **Summary**\n- **Correct solution:** Would maintain the intricate, row-and-column-dependent layout seen in the expected output.\n- **Model's approach:** Used a simplistic tiling-by-masks approach that loses the specific global structure, and sets entire rows and blocks to zero incorrectly.\n- **Key insight:** The ARC problem here **is not about block masking or tiling**; it's about row and column transformations that preserve or repeat specific positions of 7\u2019s and zeros, creating a more interlocked pattern.\n\n**That is why the solution is incorrect, despite the model's high confidence.**"

The patterns and transformations that should have been applied**\n\nLooking at the **expected output** (left) and **predicted output** (right), we can see that this ARC puzzle involves a yellow path forming a kind of \"digit 5\" in the middle of a black grid.\n\n#### **What should happen?**\n- Examine the bottom row of the yellow region:\n  - In the input, **row 5** (0-indexed) is:  \n    `[0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4]`\n- In the **expected output** (ground truth), row 5 is:  \n  `[0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4]`\n- In the **predicted output**, row 5 is:  \n  `[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4]`\n\nIn other words, **the model removed the leftmost yellow pixel on row 5**, but in the expected output, it was *not* supposed to do that.\n\n#### **Compare other rows:**\n- For rows 1 to 4: The outputs are identical between predicted and expected. The only difference is row 5.\n\n---\n\n### **2. Where the solution deviates from the expected pattern**\n\n#### **Key Difference:**\n- **In the predicted output, row 5 loses the leftmost yellow cell (at index 4), which is present in the expected output.**\n- In all previous rows, the pattern matches.\n- This shows that the logic for modifying row 5 is incorrect\u2014it **shrunk** the yellow \"bar\" in row 5 by one cell from the left, where it shouldn't have.\n\n---\n\n### **3. Insights about the underlying rule or concept**\n\n#### **What is the real rule?**\n- The expected output keeps the full width of the yellow bar in row 5, starting exactly where the yellow pixels started in the input.\n- The shape has \"blocky\" ends at the top and bottom, with no shifting of rows, no shrinking of width: it's like the yellow shape is solid as much as possible, except for hollowing out internal regions.\n\n#### **What did the model do?**\n- The model **wrongly generalized a row-wise shifting/shrinking operation**, thinking every row with yellow should lose its leftmost yellow pixel (shift right) by one.\n- This was likely based on noticing the hollowing or shape-shift in other rows but not noticing the pattern was more geometric and context-dependent.\n\n#### **What is the real transformation?**\n- The goal appears to be to \"hollow out\" an area, **removing the inner yellow (in specific places) but keeping the outer shell or border intact**.\n- In this case, row 5 must remain unchanged, confirming it is not subject to the same shift/shrink as above rows.\n- The correct rule is not a simple row-wise operation but relates to preserving the \"frame\" or \"perimeter\" of the original shape.\n\n---\n\n### **4. How the model went wrong with its plan**\n\n**Model's actual error:**\n- The model applied the *same local shifting rule* to every row, including the bottom, without attending to the **semantic/geometric role** of each row in the figure.\n- It ignored the necessity to **preserve the base or perimeter of the yellow object**.\n\n**Misinterpretation:**\n- The model assumed a mechanical operation: \"For colored rows, remove the leftmost colored pixel.\"\n- It should have realized that the operation is NOT simply local to each row, but is related to **the global structure of the shape** (probably retaining the outer border and hollowing out the inside).\n\n---\n\n## **Summary Table**\n\n| Row | Input                | Expected Output       | Predicted Output       | Error                        |\n|-----|----------------------|----------------------|------------------------|------------------------------|\n| 5   | [0,0,0,0,4,4,4,4,4,4]| [0,0,0,0,4,4,4,4,4,4]| [0,0,0,0,0,4,4,4,4,4]  | Erroneous removal of yellow  |\n\n---\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\n- **Pattern to apply:** Preserve the full horizontal bar at the base of the yellow region.\n- **Model's deviation:** Shrunk one side (left) incorrectly due to a misapplied row-local shifting rule.\n- **True underlying rule:** Likely \"preserve the border or shell of the yellow shape,\" not a uniform row operation.\n\n**The rule is structural and relates to geometry (perimeter retention), not row-wise shifting. The model's plan failed by being too simplistic and not recognizing the importance of the outer border in the pattern formation.**"

    "prompt": "You are an expert ARC puzzle solver. Your primary goal is to discover and implement the **precise logic and pattern** underlying each input-output transformation. Follow this refined methodology to maximize correct generalization and avoid common pitfalls:\n\n---\n\n### 1. **Begin with a Deep Output-First Diagnostic**\n\n- **Study the OUTPUT grids first, independently of the inputs:**  \n  - Identify any global structures, repeated motifs, geometric arrangements, or mathematical relationships.\n  - Ask: Does the output resemble a template, geometric figure, or rule-based pattern?  \n  - Is the output structure fixed, or does it change based on input details?  \n  - Note whether output features (size, location, color, shape) are completely, partially, or not at all dictated by the input grid.\n\n---\n\n### 2. **Explicitly Classify Output Dependency**\n\n- Before considering any input transformation, **decide**:  \n  - Is the output primarily determined by (A) a fixed or procedural rule/pattern, or (B) a transformation of the input?  \n- For (A):  \n  - Describe and formalize the pattern, rule, or formula generating the output\u2014independent of input variation.  \n- For (B):  \n  - Identify exactly which aspects of the input control which aspects of the output.  \n  - Look for object correspondences, positional/structural dependency, and any non-local/global logic.\n\n---\n\n### 3. **Analyze Structure, Topology, and Object Relationships**\n\n- For both output and input grids, look for:  \n  - Objects (connected shapes, boundaries, enclosures, lines)  \n  - Geometric/topological properties: closures, hollows, interiors, symmetry, alignments  \n  - Periodic, modular, or formulaic placement of elements  \n- **Avoid defaulting to local rules, color-based copying, or blockwise tiling unless all training outputs demand it.**  \n- Distinguish clearly between output \u201cshells/borders\u201d and hollow/interior regions.\n\n---\n\n### 4. **Formulate a Rule Anchored by Examples & Justification**\n\n- Summarize your hypothesized transformation as a **step-by-step natural-language rule**, referencing concrete details (including exceptions and edge cases) found in the outputs.\n- **Support every step of your rule with explicit evidence** from specific training examples.\n    - E.g., \u201cIn every output, the outermost yellow pixels remain unchanged, but the interior is hollowed out except for...\u201d\n- For input-dependent cases, specify exactly how to identify and map objects, and how to process their geometry.\n\n---\n\n### 5. **Implement via Explicit, Output-Aligned Logic**\n\n- For geometric or procedural outputs, construct the grid based on formulas, periodicity, or drawing primitives, not by copying input.\n- For input-dependent tasks, use global algorithms:  \n    - Connected-component analysis, flood-filling for enclosed regions, or shape tracing for topology.  \n    - Apply row/column slicing, shifting, or mathematical index manipulation only where supported by the pattern.\n- **Never alter or copy from the input without direct, consistent evidence in all examples.**\n\n---\n\n### 6. **Validate Hypothesis on All Training Pairs Before Coding**\n\n- Mentally or verbally simulate your rule on each training pair:\n    - Will it exactly reproduce all outputs, including structural nuances and edge cases?\n    - Is every filled, removed, or shifted cell justified by the hypothesized rule?\n    - If any cell differs, revise your rule\u2014do not proceed until all outputs are explained.\n\n---\n\n### 7. **Conclude with a Clear, Pattern-Based Rationale**\n\n- In 1-2 sentences, state the core logic or formula that determines the output pattern\u2014anchored to the properties found in the outputs and, if applicable, their relationships to the input.  \n- Highlight any geometric, object-based, or topological reasoning necessary for the transformation.\n\n---\n\n**Core Principle:**  \n*Let the output patterns drive your reasoning. Seek high-level, structural, or formulaic rules before considering input manipulation. Only map from input to output if the dependency is unambiguously proven by all examples. Always prefer geometric, global, or object-centric logic over local or color-based heuristics. Validate exhaustively\u2014no transformation should be accepted until it explains every aspect of the training outputs.*",

    "commentary": "Let's analyze **why the predicted solution is incorrect**, focusing on the logic, the expected transformation, and how the model misapplied the rules.\n\n---\n\n### 1. **Underlying Pattern/Transformation Intent**\n\nIf we study the expected output (not shown here but given in your text), we notice:\n\n- The grid is being systematically filled with **repetitions of certain blocks**, but the manner, direction, and color of these repetitions are specific:\n    - **Colors are preserved** but **positions and repetition patterns are strict**.\n    - For each colored shape, the repetition pattern (horizontal row, vertical column, grid, etc.) is determined **not just by the block's shape**, but also, as the examples suggest, by its initial orientation and/or color.\n\n#### In this puzzle specifically, the expected output shows:\n\n- **Blue blocks (originally at [7:9, 6:8]):** Tiled in a vertical band but appearing only at specific rows/columns, with spaces matching the block's size and existing separation clues.\n- **Yellow blocks:** Tiled in a vertical pattern, but notice that the pairings and gaps match **the initial groupings**.\n- **Red blocks:** Repeated, but only as specific triplets and not in an indiscriminate row/column.\n- **Green blocks:** Like the red, they are meant to be isolated to particular slots, dictated by the input's initial \"chunk\" shape.\n\n---\n\n### 2. **Deviation in the Model\u2019s Output**\n\nLet\u2019s focus on **where the predicted output went wrong**:\n\n#### **Overgeneralized Tiling**\n\n- The model simply **replicated the input blocks horizontally and vertically**, with uniform spacing but **without regard to the specific repetition mode demanded by each color/shape**.\n    - **Blue**: The model tiled the blue L-shape *horizontally* across the row, which matches the horizontal block tiling strategy. However, the pattern in the expected output is *different*\u2014the tiling should be determined by the initial separation/layout in the input.\n    - **Green**: Instead of repeating the green line *vertically or in specified grid slots*, the model tiled it horizontally across the whole row.\n    - **Red**: The model tiled red *vertically* but only in the original column, and with the wrong logic for spacing and grouping.\n    - **Yellow**: The model repeated the yellow shape as a diagonal or grid, not preserving the expected structure based on initial grouping.\n\n#### **Loss of Structure and Selective Repetition**\n\n- Many **colors/shapes are over-repeated** or **misplaced**. For example, the green and red lines fill much more of the grid than warranted, and in some cases, blocks overlap in unintended patterns.\n- The **direction and frequency** of repetition isn't aligned with the logic in the output examples: certain blocks should repeat only in specific lines, **not tiled everywhere possible**.\n\n---\n\n### 3. **Insights about the True Rule**\n\nFrom the examples:\n- The repetition pattern for each block appears **tightly constrained by the input\u2019s initial geometry and possibly by implicit grid cues or boundaries**.\n- There may be **designated places in the output grid where each pattern should go**, based on (a) color, (b) initial position, and (c) relationships between blocks.\n- The rule isn't as simple as \"repeat this shape everywhere\": rather, it's **repeat this shape at specific intervals and orientations that match what is seen in training samples**.\n\n---\n\n### 4. **How the Model Misapplied the Plan**\n\n**Model\u2019s plan was:**\n> \"For each colored input block, tile it in the inferred direction (horizontal, vertical, grid) as determined by its shape, color, and/or axis.\"\n\n**The mistakes:**\n- The model **assumed uniform tiling/spacing for all blocks**. It didn\u2019t consult the nuances shown by the examples for each color/shape.\n- The model **ignored positional or boundary-based cues** that restrict which rows/cols get which blocks.\n- The model **missed the rule that some shapes only appear a *finite number of times* in the output**, not filling their entire repeatable axis.\n\n---\n\n## **Summary Table**\n\n| Color  | Correct Placement                   | Model Output             | Error                                      |\n|--------|-------------------------------------|--------------------------|--------------------------------------------|\n| Blue   | Specific spots, matching examples   | Tiled horizontally       | Over-tiled; ignored boundary/range logic   |\n| Green  | Specific slots                      | Tiled entire row         | Over-tiled; wrong direction                |\n| Red    | Particular vertical segments        | Only in original column  | Under-tiled/not repeated correctly         |\n| Yellow | Certain vertical repeats/grid cells | Dispersed diagonally     | Doesn\u2019t match example-defined repetition   |\n\n---\n\n## **Conclusion:**\n\n**The predicted solution is incorrect because it overgeneralizes the tiling rule**\u2014blindly repeating each color block in a uniform row/column pattern\u2014**instead of following the specific, constrained repetition patterns** indicated by the input\u2019s structure and the example outputs. \n\n**Underlying rule:** The repetition (or placement) of each color block in the output is strictly determined by:\n- The **input's chunking/grouping**,\n- The **color**,\n- **Specific grid locations** as patterned in previous examples.\n\n**Fix:** The model should not treat all colors/shapes the same way; it needs to learn *which* blocks repeat *where*, and according to *what cues*, from the examples\u2014not just repeat everything everywhere."
