    "commentary": "Let's break down the outputs visually and conceptually:\n\n### 1. Patterns and Transformations That Should Have Been Applied\n\n- **Expected output:**  \n  - Forms an \"H\"-like shape in the middle using the color 0 (black), with the remaining parts colored 7 (orange).\n  - The 0s are grouped centrally in vertical bars with a connecting horizontal line (forming the crossbar of the H).\n  - Corner blocks and middle-edge blocks are uniformly filled with 7.\n\n- **Predicted output:**  \n  - The central regions are inverted: 7 fills the \"H\" structure instead of 0, and the rest of the grid alternates between 7 and 0 in a different pattern.\n  - The pattern looks more like a \"double T\" or mirrored \"I\" shapes, not matching the expected \"H\".\n\n### 2. Where the Solution Deviates From the Expected Pattern\n\n**Specific Deviations:**\n- The color assignments to regions representing the \"H\" are swapped in the predicted output.\n- The horizontal bars in the expected output (rows 3 and 6) are all 0s centrally, surrounded by 7s at the edges, but in the predicted output, those same rows have 7s in the center.\n- Columns between the central verticals do not alternate as in the expected; instead, the predicted switches the inner and outer patterns.\n\nIf you compare:\n- **Expected 1st row:** 7, 0, 7, 0, 0, 0, 7, 0, 7\n- **Predicted 1st row:** 7, 0, 7, 7, 0, 7, 0, 7, 0\n\n### 3. Insights About the Underlying Rule or Concept\n\nThe rule in the expected output seems to be:\n- Create a central \"H\" using 0s (with two vertical bars and a connecting crossbar), and fill the rest with 7s.\n\nThe predicted output appears to misinterpret the pattern:\n- It makes a mirrored pattern (possibly either filling in every other slot, or attending too literally to symmetry without anchoring to the \"H\" rule).\n- The alternating fill suggests confusion between which regions should be 0 and which should be 7.\n\n### 4. Model\u2019s Confidence\n\nThe model's confidence of 10/10 is justified, **but only if it is certain that the solution is incorrect.** In this case, the predicted output does not match the expected output **either visually or by underlying rule**. The errors are clear and persistent throughout the grid, so the confidence is warranted.\n\n---\n\n## **Summary Table**\n\n| Aspect                | Expected Output                            | Predicted Output                        | Correct?      |\n|-----------------------|--------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------|---------------|\n| Central \"H\" shape     | Made of 0s                                | Made of 7s                              | \u274c            |\n| Surrounding pattern   | Uniform 7s at corners/edges                | Alternating or mirrored 0/7 pattern     | \u274c            |\n| Consistency           | All samples consistent with \"H\" rule       | Consistent, but with wrong pattern      | \u274c            |\n| Confidence justified? | Yes, failure is obvious and patterned      | Yes                                     | \ud83d\udc4d            |\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe predicted solution is incorrect because it inverts (or otherwise misconstrues) the pattern needed to produce the \"H\" shape structure, creating a different and inconsistent arrangement of orange and black blocks. The model's high confidence is appropriate, as the errors are clear and systematic."

    "prompt": "Certainly. Here\u2019s an analysis-driven improved prompt, followed by detailed reasoning for each aspect:\n\n---\n\n**Improved ARC Prompt:**\n\nYou are a specialized solver for ARC (Abstraction and Reasoning Corpus) puzzles.\nYour goal is to derive the transformation that maps each input grid to its corresponding output grid.\n\n**For each task, follow these explicit steps:**\n\n1. **Detailed Pattern Recognition:**\n   - Carefully compare all input and output pairs in the training examples.\n   - Identify not only local differences (within rows, columns, and objects), but pay extra attention to the *global structure*\u2014including symmetry, central or edge-based features, and groupings of colors/shapes.\n   - Explicitly look for well-known configurations (e.g., letters, digits, or geometric shapes) that may appear in the output.\n\n2. **Transformation Hypothesis:**\n   - Describe, in your own words, the discovered rule(s)\u2014including which regions of the grid are affected, and how colors are mapped.\n   - Ensure that your hypothesis is consistent across ALL provided examples; generalize carefully.\n\n3. **Color and Structure Assignment:**\n   - For each *region* identified (e.g. central shapes, borders, corners), clarify what value (color/number) should be assigned\u2014don't blindly mirror or invert unless the examples justify this.\n   - Double-check for possible inversions or unintended swaps in color assignment.\n\n4. **Output Construction:**\n   - Apply the generalized transformation to the specific input grid.\n   - Verify that the output grid contains all expected pattern elements (e.g., if the task is to create a central \u201cH\u201d, check that the arrangement and colors match exactly\u2014in both shape and fill).\n   - Compare your output grid directly with training outputs to ensure fidelity.\n\n5. **Error Checking & Confirmation:**\n   - Before finalizing, cross-examine your solution with all examples for consistency.\n   - If the result diverges from expected arrangements, review steps 1\u20134 for any misinterpretations.\n\n**Your Response Format:**\n- Explicitly state the inferred rule.\n- Describe color assignment for each region referenced in the rule.\n- Provide the transformed output grid.\n- Add a brief reasoning summary confirming how your output fulfills the pattern learned from the examples.\n\n**Remember:**  \nIf a central shape or letter is required (such as an \u201cH\u201d), ensure the correct shape, size, and precise color assignment, referencing the training examples for each. Avoid accidental inversions or symmetrical misplacements.\n\n---\n\n### How This Prompt Addresses Previous Weaknesses\n\n1. **Addresses Weaknesses:**\n   - Forces explicit, stepwise articulation of pattern recognition, avoiding \u201cblack-box\u201d or superficial transformations.\n   - Calls out the risk of inversions and misassignments, which was the core issue in the failed attempt.\n\n2. **Builds on Successes:**\n   - Keeps the effective encouragement of considering transformations (rotations, color swaps) and global vs. local patterns, but adds rigor in hypothesis testing.\n\n3. **Clearer Guidance for Pattern Recognition:**\n   - Demands not just identification but *verbalization* (describe, clarify, compare) of the rule, which anchors the solution process more reliably and prevents drift into unintended outputs.\n\n4. **Better Understanding of Task Requirements:**\n   - Insists on a check against explicit visual features (e.g., forming an \"H\", not simply any central shape), reducing error due to vague pattern matching.\n   - Encourages region-based analysis (central vs. border, etc.) for precise mapping.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nThis new prompt systematically corrects the issues in the previous attempt by making the process explicit, anchored to concrete rules, region-based color assignments, and requiring explicit error checking grounded in the training examples. This will help the solver model better differentiate similar-but-different patterns, uphold global intent (e.g., building an \u201cH\u201d rather than a mirrored \u201cI\u201d), and avoid accidental inversions.",

    "commentary": "Let's analyze why the solution is incorrect with respect to the task, using your input data and the images.\n\n### 1. Patterns and Transformations That Should Have Been Applied\n\n**General rule, based on images:**\n- The green outline forms a shape, and the yellow fill is used for the inside of some (but not all) green shapes.\n- In the first (input) image, green-bordered shapes have yellow inside.\n- In the expected output, the interior of each green shape (region surrounded by green) is filled with yellow.\n\n**Transformation:**\n- **Expected:** Every closed green outline should be completely filled with yellow in the interior.\n- **Not expected:** Random yellow pixels outside or partly filling open shapes.\n\n### 2. Where the Solution Deviates from the Expected Pattern\n\n**Direct comparison:**\n- In the expected output (the JSON labeled \"Expected output\"), every green-bordered shape has its inside filled with yellow, forming solid blocks.\n- In the model's predicted output, many yellow regions are:\n  - **Incomplete:** The yellow fill is missing inside some green shapes; only partial or single yellow cells appear where a full fill is expected.\n  - **Disjointed:** Some yellow appears disconnected or in the wrong spots, not obeying the boundaries of the green outlines.\n  - **Misplaced:** Some yellow appears outside the green outlines, which should *never* happen per the true rule.\n\n**Examples:**\n- Row 2, column 3: Expected output is a 4 (yellow), predicted is 0 (empty).\n- Predicted output has yellow (4) appearing as stray single pixels not consistently filling the green shapes.\n\n### 3. Insights About the Underlying Rule or Concept\n\n**Underlying concept:**\n- The task is to recognize closed shapes (polygons) formed by green outlines and fill their interiors entirely with yellow.\n- The model fails to identify and fill the complete interior of all green-bordered shapes.\n- It appears to only partially fill, or places yellow without regard to shape closure or interior/exterior distinction.\n\n### 4. Whether the Model's Confidence Was Appropriate\n\n**Model's confidence: 10/10 (maximum confidence)**\n- Given the obvious visible and logical deviation from the pattern, this confidence is **not justified**. The model made clear errors and applied the rule incorrectly.\n- A more reasonable confidence would be much lower (closer to 1-3/10), reflecting that some of the pattern (the presence of yellow) is recognized, but the fundamental interior-filling logic is not followed.\n\n---\n\n## **Summary**\n\n- **Correct pattern:** Fill the inside of every green-bordered shape entirely with yellow.\n- **Mistake:** The model fills only partially and places yellow poorly, without respecting green boundaries.\n- **Conclusion:** The solution is incorrect for failing to adhere to the closed-shape fill rule. The model's high confidence is not appropriate.\n\nIf you need further breakdown (e.g., row-by-row analysis), let me know!"

Here\u2019s a new, highly targeted prompt designed to address the key weaknesses observed in previous attempts, leverage strengths, and provide clearer and more actionable guidance for solving ARC puzzles:\n\n---\n\n**Expert ARC Puzzle Solver Prompt (v3) \u2014 Precision & Verification Focus**\n\nYou are an expert ARC (Abstraction and Reasoning Corpus) puzzle solver.  \nYour task is not only to identify patterns and transformations, but to explicitly test, verbalize, and verify your hypotheses at every stage, ensuring precise adherence to the task's true logical structure as demonstrated in the training examples.\n\n**For each ARC task, follow these mandatory steps:**\n\n---\n\n### 1. Systematic Training Analysis  \n- Examine and compare ALL provided input\u2013output (training) pairs.\n- For each pair, list explicitly:\n  - The changes and consistencies (e.g., colors, positions, shapes/objects, structure).\n  - Any global features (e.g., symmetry, centrality, object enclosure).\n  - Any region-level assignments (e.g., borders, centers, backgrounds).\n\n### 2. Pattern Hypothesis & *Explicit Rule Articulation*  \n- Formulate a hypothesis in clear language describing:\n  - The transformation from input to output (what specifically is changed, where, and how).\n  - The criteria that determine which cells or regions are affected.\n  - How colors or values are mapped or reassigned.\n- **State your rule in a format like:**  \n  - \"For every [object/region type] meeting [criteria], do [transformation], assigning [color/value] to [region/cells].\"\n- **Avoid assumed inversions, blanket color swaps, or speculative symmetry unless justified by *all* examples.**\n\n### 3. Targeted Pattern Verification  \n- Before applying your rule, *simulate* it mentally or in a concise textual grid and cross-check it against ALL training outputs.\n  - Explicitly note any exceptions or mismatches and revise your hypothesis if inconsistencies appear.\n  - If your rule does *not* produce exactly the observed output for each training example, iterate and refine.\n\n### 4. Output Construction Aligned to Rule  \n- With the finalized, consistent rule, apply it step by step to the test input.\n  - As you transform, reference each sub-step back to the training rule for consistency.\n  - For spatially complex tasks (letters, enclosures, structural fills), explicitly mark (in writing) which cells/regions fulfill which aspect of the rule.\n\n### 5. Error Checking & Explanation  \n- Visually and logically compare your candidate output to ALL training outputs for the analogous mapping.\n- Ask yourself:\n  - Does every filled region, outline, and color assignment *precisely* match the pattern demonstrated?\n  - Is there any region in my proposed output inconsistent with the explicit logic extracted from training examples?\n- *Explain* in 1\u20132 sentences why your output obeys the training-derived rule. If any ambiguity exists, address it.\n\n**Response Format:**\n- Clear, explicit English description of the rule/hypothesis.\n- Concise statement of how the rule applies to the current input.\n- The output grid.\n- Brief justification describing correspondence to training examples and confirmation of no extraneous elements or rule violations.\n\n---\n\n**Special Guidance:**\n- **Prioritize region-based reasoning** over pixelwise or superficial swap/symmetry. For example, if shapes are enclosed or particular areas (e.g., the \u201cinside\u201d of outlined regions) receive a specific fill or transformation, always define them spatially and apply accordingly.\n- **Avoid overgeneralizing from one feature (e.g., only central columns/rows or simple color swaps).** Always test that *all* output features from training are present and mapped correctly in your solution.\n- **Final check:** If your output would fail if directly compared side-by-side with training outputs (shape, placement, color, or fill inaccuracies), revisit and revise your solution.\n\n---\n\n## Why This Prompt Is Stronger\n\n- **Addresses Previous Weaknesses:**  \n  - Directs the model to avoid color inversion/symmetry errors by requiring region-based, explicitly justified transformation.\n  - Forces side-by-side validation with all examples so systematic errors become clear during solution construction.\n\n- **Builds on Successes:**  \n  - Retains explicit pattern analysis, but mandates hypothesis testing and reformulation when mismatches are detected.\n\n- **Guides Pattern Recognition:**  \n  - Insists on clear, stepwise articulation and simulation before application, so pattern understanding is not \u201cblack-box\u201d or superficial.\n\n- **Enhances Task Understanding:**  \n  - Requires detailed matching between proposed output and all training outputs in both logic and shape, disallowing accidental omissions or misapplied fills/symmetries.\n\n---\n\n**Use this prompt as a rigorous template for each new ARC puzzle.**  \nIt should sharply reduce errors due to color inversion, missed regional relationships, or superficial symmetry, helping the model to generate solutions that strictly respect the essential task logic.",

Insights About the Underlying Rule\n\nFrom the images and JSON, the underlying rule seems to require:\n- Locating color block motifs.\n- Replicating these patterns at *regular intervals* across sections of the grid (like a tiling or stamping operation).\n- Maintaining the integrity of the motif (shape and placement).\n\nThe **predicted output fails** to:\n- Correctly identify the motif's boundaries.\n- Consistently replicate and align the motifs through the grid.\n- Show the correct periodic tiling pattern.\n\n### 4. Was the Model's Confidence Appropriate?\n\nThe model\u2019s confidence was 10/10 for marking this as incorrect, which is **appropriate**:\n- The predicted output clearly does not reflect the expected pattern.\n- Distinct blocks are missing, and replication rules are broken.\n- The overall transformation logic is not followed.\nThus, high confidence in marking this as incorrect is justified.\n\n---\n\n## **Summary Table**\n\n| Aspect                     | Expected Output                        | Predicted Output                      | Error/Observation                                         |\n|----------------------------|----------------------------------------|---------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------|\n| Motif Detection            | Correct motifs, preserved blocks       | Partial and fragmented motifs         | Prediction fails to identify complete shapes              |\n| Pattern Replication        | Regular, repeating tiling of motifs    | Missing or inconsistent tiling        | No regular pattern seen in the prediction                 |\n| Alignment/Placement        | Motifs appear at precise intervals     | Motifs misplaced or absent            | Placement is inconsistent                                |\n| Confidence                 | Model said incorrect, confidence 10/10 | Correct assessment                    | High confidence appropriate due to clear deviation        |\n\n---\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\n**The solution is incorrect** because it fails to:\n- Replicate the blocks of color at the correct intervals.\n- Preserve or correctly copy the motifs in their entirety.\n- Recognize or apply the periodic tiling pattern of the motifs.\n\n**The model\u2019s high confidence was appropriate.** The transformation logic is clearly violated, and the predicted output is very far from the intended result."
